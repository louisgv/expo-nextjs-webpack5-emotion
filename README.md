# expo-nextjs-webpack-5

An experiment to get the @expo/next-adapter working with the latest NextJS 11.x features

> Please checkout the tag `<=10.2` if your still using Next 10.x

## TLDR: How to use this in your own project

- `npm i --save-dev postcss`
- Copy the patches folder to your project
- Add `"postinstall": "npx patch-package",` to your package.json scripts
- `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

## Local dev 

If using yarn

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

If using npm

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
```

### FYI

The expo packages are in active development and the version numbers may not match the patches listed here. They should still work, but just create an issue if they don't

## Issues

> NPM install fails due to peer dependencies

Use `--legacy-peer-deps` when installing

> Babel class properties errors when building \_document.tsx

~~Resolved by patching @expo/next-adapter to add the missing babel transform~~

Resolved by patching the _document.tsx

> `TypeError: Cannot read property 'version' of undefined`

~~Resolved by locking "html-webpack-plugin" to "5.3.0"~~

Fixed by patching withUnimodules to only used the required plugins (avoiding html-webpack-plugin from being loaded)

> NextJS pages do not compile

Resolved by patching ignoreExternalModules to Webpack5 syntax

> NextJS react transform conflicts with Expo react trasform

~~Resolved by patching babel-preset-expo to enable useTransformReactJsxExperimental~~

Resolved by patching babel-preset-expo to correctly identify the NextJS 11 bundler allowing options to be passed in. Requires v8.4.0. PR created https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/13327 

> PostCSS Errors when building in production

~~`optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin` is deprecated for Webpack5. Need to patch @expo/webpack-config to use `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`~~

Better fix is to simply install `postcss` at the top level. This will ensure NextJS is using `postcss 8.x`

> React-native-web cannot use import outside of module

Add `react-native-web` to Next transpile modules

NOTE: This is a work around and not always needed. This is a temp fix until the underlying problem is understood
