# expo-nextjs-webpack5-emotion

An experiment to get a bunch of stuff working together:

  - [x] [Next.js]
  - [x] [Webpack 5]
  - [x] [@emotion/native]

## Known Issues

> React-native-web cannot use import outside of module

Add `react-native-web` to Next transpile modules

NOTE: This is a work around and not always needed. This is a temp fix until the underlying problem is understood
